# Part 1 - Data Exploration in BigQuery

Skills used: Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

Given the provided Covid-19 dataset to explore, here is a brief description of the most insightful topics chosen to further analyze with visualizations in part 2.

* death_percentage - (total_deaths/total_cases)
* total_deaths - SUM(new_deaths)
* percent_population_infected - (total_cases/population)
* percent_population_infected - MAX((total_cases/population))
* highest_infection_count - MAX(total_cases)

# Part 2 - Data Visualization in Tableau

Here's a quick rundown of what was done to complete the data visualization project.

* Downloaded and saved sql results as individual .xlsx sheets.
* Created a new viz and uploaded each .xlsx as a data source for individual Tableau sheets.
* Filtered data down, formatted, and designed each sheet.
* Created a dashboard and made final design adjustments to develop a final product.
